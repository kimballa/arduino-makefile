* The profiles should explicitly call out the PKG_LIBRARIES_ROOT
  (packages/foo/hardware/xx/1.2.3/libraries/) as its own variable. 
  * Any lib deps declared in `libs := foo bar baz` should thus also add
    `-isystem$(CORE_LIBRARIES_ROOT)/foo` and  `.../bar` and `.../baz` as header search 
    paths.
  * All the .c/.cpp/.S files in each of those dirs should get copied into build/libdeps/foo/
  * ... and those copied versions should get compiled
  * ... and added to a build/libdeps/libproj_deps.a
  * ... which should be linked into the final build with -lproj_deps (with -Lbuild/libdeps/)


* If there are multiple include dirs, it flattens them all into the same
  /arduino-install/include/ destination. e.g. foo.h and bar/baz.h are just both
  copied into .../include/{foo.h, baz.h} and the `bar/` subdir is just forgotten
  about.
